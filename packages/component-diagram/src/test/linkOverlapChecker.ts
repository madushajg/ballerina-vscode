/**
 * A systematic, whole-diagram check for the "a link visibly cuts through an unrelated node" class
 * of bug, replacing eyeballing screenshots one layout at a time.
 *
 * It drives the *production* pipeline end to end - `buildDiagramData` (the same graph
 * `Diagram.tsx` builds) -> `autoDistribute` (which positions every column and internally runs
 * `avoidLinkObstructions`) -> the real rounded-orthogonal geometry every link is painted from -
 * then samples each link's path and tests it against every *other* node's real bounding box.
 *
 * Nothing here re-derives layout or path math: node boxes come from `getNodeBoundingBox`, endpoint
 * anchors from the shared `getLinkAnchors`, the axis-aligned shape from `orthogonalizePoints`, and
 * the sampled path from `sampleRoundedOrthogonalPath` - the same functions `avoidLinkObstructions`
 * routes with and `getSVGPath` serializes. `assertPathMatchesGeometry` pins that last equivalence
 * per link so the points sampled here are provably the ones the widget draws.
 *
 * What is deliberately *not* shared is the collision test. Production asks "does this shape touch
 * the box at all" to decide whether to reroute; this file asks "how far inside the box does it
 * get" with its own point-in-box math, so a passing suite means something independent of the
 * predicate the pass makes its decision with.
